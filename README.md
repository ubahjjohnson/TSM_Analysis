# Tenant Satisfaction Measures (TSM) Analysis for Low-Income Rental Accommodation in the UK

This project analyzes the **Tenant Satisfaction Measures (TSM) dataset** to assess tenant satisfaction with services provided by landlords of low-income rental accommodations across the UK. By leveraging Python's powerful data analysis and visualization libraries, this analysis aims to provide insights into key areas of tenant experience and landlord performance.

## Key Features

* **Data-driven Insights:** Explore trends in tenant satisfaction over time and identify areas requiring improvement.
* **Performance Benchmarking:** Compare actual performance against year-end targets.
* **Categorical Performance Analysis:** Understand the strengths and weaknesses across different service categories.
* **Year-over-Year Comparisons:** Track changes in satisfaction levels annually.
* **Heatmap Visualization:** Identify correlations and patterns within the TSM data.

## Analysis & Visualization

The analysis was performed using **Python** and the following libraries:

* `pandas`: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.
* `numpy`: For numerical operations.
* `matplotlib.pyplot`: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
* `seaborn`: For drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

The project generates **5 insightful charts**:

1.  **Trend of Measures Across Quarters:** Visualizes how tenant satisfaction measures evolve over different quarters.
2.  **Year-End Target Bar Chart:** Compares achieved tenant satisfaction levels against pre-defined year-end targets.
3.  **Categories Performance Bar Chart:** Breaks down performance by different service categories (e.g., repairs, communication, neighborhood management).
4.  **Year-over-Year Chart:** Illustrates the change in tenant satisfaction from one year to the next.
5.  **Heatmap:** Provides a comprehensive overview of relationships and patterns within the TSM data, helping to identify strong or weak correlations between different measures.

## Getting Started

To run this analysis locally, please follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone github.com/ubahjjohnson/TSM
    cd main
    ```

2.  **Install the required Python libraries:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate the virtual environment
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Install the libraries
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
    ```
